   <hr />
   <br />
   <p>She had spent the last ten years in ths room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do.</q> Although many considered her poineering workm unraveling the secrets of the llama <acronym title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</acronym>, to be outstanding achievement, Molly <i>did</i> think she had something better to do.</p>
